            <dt>UX/UI Designer @ Landing.jobs</dt>
            <dd>Landing.jobs is a tech recruitment startup based in Lisbon, Portugal. It was great working with such a young and enthusiastic team. I was responsible for the entire design process, from user research, wireframing, mockup design and even implementing my designs using CSS (SCSS), HTML (Slim) and JavaScript. The team was small and my role was very versatile.</dd>
            <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
            <p><b>Resoursefulness and pragmatism.</b> I learned to focus my attention on the right things, and to use the minimum amount of resources for the maximum amount of impact.</p>

            <dt>Digital Product Designer @ Major</dt>
            <dd>I had the oportunity to join Major in 2017. This Lisbon based design studio was founded by a former teacher of mine and the Beyoncé of digital design, Leihla Pinho. At Major, I was responsible for user research, wireframing and delivering final high fidelity designs. I was constantly communicating with our clients, presenting our work and working with their internal teams. The team at Major is absolutely incredible, and I have so much respect for them (shoutout to Leihla, Tânia, Susana and Carlos). It was a priviledge working with such incredible professionals.</dd>
            <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
            <p><b>Diplomacy and craftsmanship.</b> I learned how to share my thoughts in a diplomatic, constructive manner. They also taught me,  by example, that pushing yourself to make the best possible work you can is what separates the average from the great, and that I should always strive for better. Bonus learning: dream big! Everything is possible, if you set your  mind to it!</p>

            <dt>Freelance UX/UI Designer</dt>
            <dd>In 2018 I had the opportunity to move to Berlin and I toke it! The initial plan was to find a job and work full-time in Germany, and I wanted to find some freelance projects to work on while I searched for a new job. Thing is... I enjoyed being a freelancer so much that I never even started a formal job search. I've been very fortunate to work with some incredible people so far. I even had the chance to work with Landing.jobs again (feels great to have a "returning client")! I am now working with a non-profit organization called okTurtles, on a project called Group Income.</dd>
            <h2>Lessons learned (so far)</h2>
            <p><b>Discipline and self-love.</b> There's no denying that setting your own schedule and goals is intimidating. I am still working on it, and I am so thankfull to be in this journey. I really do feel that after this lesson is learned, the sky is the limit for me. I also learned how to be my own cheerleader, and to be mindful of how I think of myself and my work. I learned to respect the process, and to accept that great things take time, and if I want to be great at something, it will take time!</p>
